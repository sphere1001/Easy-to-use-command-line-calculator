# Easy-to-use-command-line-calculator
a small tool to provide you with a command line calculator. It's not "bc" ,but it should calculate pow, log, and sqrt as well as basic operations.

Use it like : " programName.exe 10 + 12 - 13 * 14 / 15 pow 16 sqt loga = "
You have to leave spaces in between the operands and a fundamental 
'=' as the last operator.

It only works in sequence ,without parenthesis rules.
